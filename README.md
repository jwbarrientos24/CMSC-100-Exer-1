# As a creator:
After cloning the main branch on my local device, I created a folder named Barrientos and put my expectations.txt inside.
Afterwards, I pushed the changes to a new branch and created a pull request.

# As a Reviewer:
I reviewed my partners pull request, I made a mistake on my part by not reviewing my partners pull request carefully.
After it was merged, I could see that there was a lacking part which is a folder named after my partner's surname.
He had to do another pull request and I had to merge another pull request
